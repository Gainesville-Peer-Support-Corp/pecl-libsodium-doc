You shouldn't need a Ph.D in Applied Cryptography to build a secure web 
application. Enter libsodium, which allows developers to develop fast, secure,
and reliable applications without needing to know what a stream cipher even is.

After reading this brief electronic manual, you should...

* Know what libsodium is, what features it has, and how to install it (both the 
  library and the PHP extension from PECL).
* Generally understand which cryptography tool to use for a specific scenario.
* Be capable of writing production-quality code that uses libsodium.

> This is very much a work in progress. Development is taking place at
