You shouldn't need a Ph.D in Applied Cryptography to build a secure web 
application. Enter libsodium, which allows developers to develop fast, secure,
and reliable applications without needing to know what a stream cipher even is.

After reading this brief electronic manual, you should...

* Know what libsodium is, what features it has, and how to install it (both the 
  library and the PHP extension from PECL).
* Generally understand which cryptography tool to use for a specific scenario.
* Be capable of writing production-quality code that uses libsodium.

Chapter 1 should explain what libsodium is, introduce some basic concepts, and
guide you through installing libsodium and the PHP extension.

Chapter 2 aims to be a useful reference page for all the functions and constants
exposed by libsodium.

Chapters 3 - 9 cover the various functions that libsodium offers, what their
purpose is, and how to use them.

Chapter 10 contains "recipes": Example code that uses libsodium to satisfy a
project requirement.
